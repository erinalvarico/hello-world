The traditional "hello-world" tutorial! A compilation of ideas, discussions and tested concepts.

ABOUT ME

Hello! My name is Erin Alvarico, an aspiring computer science major at Marist College!
I am aiming to graduate in 2022 with a B.S., with my concentration in game design.

I hope to one day work for a game development team at AAA companies to obtain hands-on experience
in working on and creating a full-scale game. Later on I hope to direct and build my own games under
my own company.

Aside from being infatuated with coding and game design, I am a very active individual.
I was a competitive dancer for over 11 years, a gymnast for 4 years and now training
as a cheerleader for the Marist Red Foxes! I love to draw and animate too!

This document will most likely be updated with more information I'd like to share with the
"world", but I'm excited start showcasing my projects and talent on GitHub!

Thank you for reading this tutorial test note!
